#Von Neumann Architecture

Computer architecture is an abstract model. It splits a computer into four 
distinct parts: Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit, Computer Memory, 
and computer input/output. The ALU and Control Unit make up the 
central processing unit, or CPU.

Arithmetic Logic Unit:
- performs basic operations such as plus, minus, times, division and logical
operations such as and, or, and not.

Control Unit:
- coordinates the operation and sequence of data movements between the 
other parts of the architecture

Computer Memory:
- stores both data and programs
- Types of memory
    - temporary memory known as random access memory(RAM)
    - lasting memory such as hard drives/ ssd
    
Computer Input/Output:
- enables communication between the computer and external world i.e.:
    - the user
    - peripherals
    - other computers
    
These are the simplified and generalized concepts of computer architecture.
