# Project: Humidity Controlled Storage

This folder contains the source code and relevant files such as the FreeRTOS zip file specifically for the AVR ATMega2560 microcontroller. Follow this link:  for the DHT
sensor non blocking library used in the main source code. The Arduino IDE was used to compile and upload to the microcontroller but in an attempt to maximize learning 
experience there is minimal usage of Arduino API.
